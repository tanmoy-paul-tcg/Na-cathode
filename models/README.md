## Following models were tested for prediction of voltage. 


### [LASSO](lasso/lasso.py)

### [XGBoost](xgboost/xgboost.py)

### [SVM](svm/svm.py)

### [Ridge Regressor](ridgeRegression/ridgeRegModel2.py)
 
 
Once best performing model is obtained [predict.py](predict.py) file can then be used for prediction.
